\section{General Model}


\subsection{Oracle}

  The Oracle issues totaly supply 1 of the vote token and desires some state $S_t \in \{0, 1\}$ to
  be reported correctly. The Oracle does not know the true value of $S_t$ but believes that
  $S_t = 1$ with probability $p_0 \geq 0.5$. The Oracle then uses votes by individuals as signals
  about the true state and will report $0$ if enough voters report $s = 0$\footnote{Enough is
  determined by treating the Oracle as a Bayesian decision maker. It reports $\hat{S} = 0$ if
  $\text{Prob}(S_t = 0) > 0.5$}.

  The Oracle then punishes those who vote with the minority by taking a fraction $\gamma$ of their
  vote coins and rewards those who voted with majority by giving them $(1 - \gamma) \frac{\pi}{1 -
  \pi}$ vote coins where $\pi$ is the fraction who voted the minority vote.

  The Oracle is responsible for protecting $\mu_t$ margin in some system and generates revenue
  $\Pi_t = \tau_t(\mu_t) \mu_t$. $\mu_t$ follow some stochastic process. The Oracle pays the revenue
  out as dividends to vote token holders.


\subsection{Individuals}

  There are two types of individuals who are identical in every dimension except for one: the
  \textit{truth-tellers} always report the truth ($s_t = 1$) and \textit{liars} always report a lie
  ($s_t = 0$). Both types of individuals buy and sell vote tokens, $c$, and risk-free bonds, $b$,
  with return $r$. They are both risk-averse and gain utility from consumption. Individuals
  sometimes make mistakes when voting by either (1) forgetting to vote (non-participation) or (2)
  making a mistake when they vote (trembling hand). The probability with which they forget to vote
  is a constant probability and is given by $\eta$, whereas, the probability with which individuals
  make a mistake is random (but shared across all individuals in a given period!) and distributed
  according to the beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

  Truth-tellers and liars both form representative families where they share risk perfectly across
  individuals.

  A truth-teller entering a period where Oracle protects $\mu_t$ margin and where the truth-teller
  has wealth $w_t$ faces the following problem:

  \begin{align}
    V(w_t, \mu_t) &= \max_{b_{t+1}, c_{t+1}} u(w_t) + \beta E_x \left[ V(w_{t+1}, \mu_{t+1}) \right] \\
    w_{t+1} &= (1 + r) b_{t+1} + c_{t+1} (1 + \gamma(x_{t+1}, \hat{S}_{t+1})) (d_{t+1}(\mu_{t+1}) + p_{t+1}(\mu_{t+1}, \hat{S}_t))
  \end{align}

  Additionally, liars have a stake in the margin that is protected by the Oracle. In particular, if
  the liars can corrupt the Oracle, aka $\hat{S}_t = 0$, then they collect $\kappa \mu_t$
  as an additional payoff where $\kappa \leq \frac{1}{2}$.\footnote{$\kappa$ represents the portion
  of the margin that can be seized if liars successfully corrupt the Oracle.} Thus, a liar entering
  a period with wealth $w_t$ when the Oracle protects $\mu_t$ margin faces the following problem:

  \begin{align}
    \tilde{V}(w_t, \mu_t) &= \max_{b_{t+1}, c_{t+1}} u(w_t) + \beta E_x \left[ \tilde{V}(w_{t+1}, \mu_{t+1}) \right] \\
    w_{t+1} &= (1 + r) b_{t+1} + c_{t+1} (1 + \gamma(x_{t+1}, \hat{S}_{t+1})) (d_{t+1}(\mu_{t+1}) + p_{t+1}(\mu_{t+1}, \hat{S}_{t+1})) + \mathcal{I}_{\tilde{S}_t = 0} \kappa \mu_{t+1}
  \end{align}


\subsection{Truthful Oracle}

  A \textit{Truthful Oracle} is an Oracle policy $(\gamma, \tau_t(\mu_t)$ such that $\hat{S}_t = 1$. This is done
  by ensuring that the truth-tellers value the token more than the liars do.

  A \textit{Truthful Equilibrium} is

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Value functions $V, \tilde{V}: \mathcal{R}^+ \times \mathcal{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$
    \item Policy functions $b^*, c^*, \tilde{b}^*, \tilde{c}^*: \mathcal{R}^+ \times \mathcal{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{+}$
    \item Prices $p_t : \mu \times \{0, 1\} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{+}$
    \item Oracle dividend function $d_t \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{+} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^+$
    \item Oracle redistribution policy: $\gamma \in (0, 1)$
  \end{enumerate}

  such that

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Value functions and policy functions are optimal given prices
    \item $\tilde{c}^* = 0$
    \item The Oracle is truthful
    \item Prices clear markets
  \end{itemize}
