In this version of the model, we will consider the system margin being constant over time. However,
it is important to note that not all of the variables will be constant in the steady state because
there is potentially non-zero inflation in the number of outstanding tokens. The number of tokens in
the economy follows

\begin{align*}
  S_{t+1} &= (1 + \pi) (S_t - B_t)
\end{align*}

Also, recall from \ref{sec:price_required} that the price that ensures $PfC < CoC$ is given by
$p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_t}{S_t}$.

The token market cap, $p_t S_t$, will be a constant since

\begin{align*}
  p_t S_t &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_t}{S_t} S_t \\
  &= \frac{2}{1 - \eta} PfC_t
\end{align*}

and since $PfC_t = \bar{PfC} = \gamma \bar{M}$ then

$$p_t S_t = \bar{pS} = \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \gamma \bar{M}$$

Assume that we'd like to achieve a period-by-period return of $r$.

\begin{align*}
  (1 + r) &= \frac{p_{t+1} (S_{t+1} + B_{t+1})}{p_t S_t} \\
  (1 + r) &= \frac{p_{t+1} S_{t+1} + X_{t+1}}{p_t S_t} \\
  (1 + r) &= \frac{\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_{t+1}}{S_{t+1}} S_{t+1} + X_{t+1}}{\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_{t}}{S_t} S_t} \\
  (1 + r) PfC_{t} &= PfC_{t+1} + \frac{1 - \eta}{2} X_{t+1} \\
\end{align*}

In the SS this means that

\begin{align*}
  (1 + r) \bar{PfC} &= \bar{PfC} + \frac{1 - \eta}{2} \bar{X} \\
  &\rightarrow \bar{X} = \frac{2 \bar{PfC}}{1 - \eta} r
\end{align*}

If we assume that $\bar{PfC} = \frac{1}{2} \bar{M}$ and that there is full participation then this
reduces to $\bar{X} = r \bar{M}$ which means that the tax rate is given by,

$$\bar{\tau} \equiv \frac{\bar{X}}{\bar{M}} = r$$
