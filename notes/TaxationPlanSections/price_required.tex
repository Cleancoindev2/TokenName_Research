In this section we determine what price is needed in a generic period to ensure that $PfC < CoC$.

We begin with the inequality

\begin{align*}
  PfC_t \leq CoC_t \rightarrow PfC_t \leq \frac{1 - \eta}{2} p_t S_t \\
  \rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{PfC_t}{S_t}
  \rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}
\end{align*}

Thus as long as the price of a token is higher than $\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}$,
then it is not profitable to corrupt the system.
