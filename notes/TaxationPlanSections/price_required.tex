In this section we express the price needed to maintain the $PfC < CoC$ inequality in terms of
model primitives:

We rearrange the inequality in the following manner

\begin{align*}
  PfC_t \leq CoC_t \\
  \Rightarrow \gamma M_t \leq \frac{1 - \eta}{2} p_t S_t \\
  \Rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}
  \Rightarrow p_t \geq \frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}
\end{align*}

Thus as long as the price of a token is higher than $\frac{2}{1 - \eta} \frac{\gamma M_t}{S_t}$,
then it is not profitable to corrupt the system.
